To-do-list

Here is the to-do-list which i have built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML for text-box, image display,button etc. 
CSS is used for padding, styling features, font styling etc.
JavaScript is used for the logic which is used to add, delete or cancel the tasks.

This To-do-list enables the user to add a task, delete a task and cancel the completed task. 
This is how my To-do-list looks like:
